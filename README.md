This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. create file in the project root for .env.local

include the following in the file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=Your_OpenAI_Key

IMPORTANT:  Don't deploy or upload this example!!!  You should never really expose your key this way in javascript but for demo purposes you can use it in the current config.


2. Install all the packages

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
